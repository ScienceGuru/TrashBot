# TrashBot
A challenge to build inexpensive robots of various types.


TrashBot 1.0  is a "final" project for an Arduino UNO class. Running total cost $21.00 ($20 of that was a 10-pack of 9g servos), NOT including the Arduino because I already had it. I see no reason why you couldn't use a clone.
It's a 4DOF robot arm built without a motor shield. (UNO can run signal to 6 PWM motors natively)
If you want a TrashBot of your very own, you'll need a breadboard, a handful of POTs, and a bunch of stuff that your average nerd has lying around the house.
More can be found in the repo files.
