# TrashBot
A challenge to build inexpensive robots of various types.


TrashBot 1.0  is a "final" project for an Arduino UNO class. Running total cost $29.00 ($20 of that was a 10-pack of 9g servos), NOT including the Arduino because I already had it. I see no reason why you couldn't use a clone.
It's a 3DOF robot arm built without a motor shield. (UNO can take signal from up to 6 sources natively)
If you want a TrashBot of your very own, you'll need a breadboard, a handful of POTs, and a bunch of stuff that your average nerd has lying around the house.
More can be found in the repo files.

TrashBot 2.0
Replaced tongue depressors with cut acrylic (an old ruler, cut up). Mounted to plastic turntable. Better code.
